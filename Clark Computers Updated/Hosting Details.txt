Getting started with your Hosting Account

1. Set up your domain name
The domain you are using will need to be set up to point to your new hosting service. To do this, you will need to set up the nameservers for your domain to the values below. Note: It may take 24-48 hours for the DNS changes to propagate worldwide. If it’s crucial for you to see your website right away then it may make sense to edit hosts file on your local PC.

 
Our Nameservers
NS1	dns1.namecheaphosting.com
NS2	dns2.namecheaphosting.com
My domain was purchased through Namecheap. Do I need to do anything?
You can easily update nameservers through our control panel. This KB Article will walk you through these steps.

My domain was purchased through another registrar.
If your domain name is registered with another company you will need to update your nameservers through their control panel or support system.

2. Manage Your Web Hosting in cPanel
cPanel is the control center of your web hosting account. Through cPanel you can edit configuration of email, FTP, databases, as well as other features.

cPanel login details are provided above.

You can also add addon domains using this manual.

3. Use FTP to Upload Your Site
We recommend using FTP to upload your website. We support all of the popular FTP clients and protocols. If you prefer to upload your website using just your web browser, you'll find File Manager in your cPanel.

It is strongly recommended to use SFTP connection for better security. However, if custom ports are blocked in your network you can also use plain FTP.
